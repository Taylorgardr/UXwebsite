      <h2>Designing with Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a college student currently studying UX design, driven by a passion for creating thoughtful, inclusive, and intuitive digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        My design philosophy is centered on empathy, accessibility, and usability. I believe that the best digital products are built when we deeply understand the people who use them—and remove as many barriers as possible in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working at the intersection of design and research, combining visual creativity with critical thinking to solve real problems. Whether it's improving a form flow or designing a responsive layout, I always keep the user at the heart of the process.
      </p>

      <h2>Core UX Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User research & usability testing</li>
        <li>Wireframing & prototyping (Figma, Adobe XD)</li>
        <li>Accessible design principles (WCAG)</li>
        <li>Responsive web design (HTML, CSS)</li>
        <li>Information architecture & interaction design</li>
        <li>Design thinking & iterative processes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As I continue to grow in this field, I'm excited to collaborate, experiment, and keep building better experiences—one screen at a time.
